Class: 
I represent a Cohort, which means an 'execution' of a semester: for example: 'cohort202202' is the semester that starts in Feb2022 and lasts until July2022.

Responsibility:
For a cohort, all semesters that I as a Teacher work in will have a directory, in which info about student and their work can be stored, and my notes on that. 

Collaborators:
Semester - a cohort contains Semesters that I teach in during that runnig semester.   
Student  - a Student gathers info about a student in the running semester.
